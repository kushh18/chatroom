The Python code above defines four functions and uses several built-in Python functions. 
Here is a brief description of each function:

1) map_fn(chunk): This function takes in a chunk of the input data as input and produces a list of key-value pairs, 
where the key is a word and the value is 1. It iterates over the words in the input chunk, and if the word is not already in a dictionary, 
it adds the word to the dictionary with a value of 1. If the word is already in the dictionary, it increments the value by 1.

2)partition_fn(key_value_pairs, num_partitions): This function takes in a list of key-value pairs and the number of partitions as input, 
and returns a list of partitions, where each partition is a list of key-value pairs. It uses the built-in hash function to compute the hash 
of each key and assigns it to a partition based on the modulo of the hash value with the number of partitions.

3)reduce_fn(partition): This function takes in a partition as input and produces a list of key-value pairs, where the key is a word and the value 
is the count of the word across all the input data. It iterates over the key-value pairs in the partition and uses a dictionary to accumulate the 
counts of each word.

4)The main function does not have a specific name, but it divides the input data into chunks and creates multiple threads to simulate the MapReduce framework. 
It also combines the results from the Reduce functions to obtain the final output.
